 /* Problem Statement :
  - Write an application to accept a ?square? matrix from the user, and rotate it.
  - print the result.
  
  This is not really a problem in the real world.. this is just to learn 2D arrays!!

/*
 Accept from user:
 -> size of square matrix (rows, columns)
 -> each element. (row by row)
 
 Print the matrix entered by the user
 
 rotate the matrix
 
 print the rotated matrix.

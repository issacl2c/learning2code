Learning to code using data structures, algorithms in C

This GIT Repository was created to practice for Google's embedded software engineering interview. 
The programs found here are my OWN interpretations of:
- Implementation of common data structures used in operating systems
- Methods to manipulate these data structure
- Implementation of common multithreading problems 

Reference books:

- Data structures and Algorithm Analysis in C - Edition 2 : Mark Allan Weiss
- Linux Kernel Development - Robert Love
- Operating Systems Concepts - Peter B Galvin & Co.

To learn the hardware side of things:
- Digital Design and Computer Architecture - Sarah Harris& David Harris
- Youtube: https://youtu.be/R0tFDXBZvKI
  - Provides a bottom up understanding of all things computer architectures (starts right from voltage level)
  - Relevant for google interview (for someone with medium embedded knowledge): videos 117 - 145 in the above list.
